//generate random number between 1 and total numbers of words and set number to var i -- var i = Floor (total#ofwords*(math.randomnumber)) 

//Set Selected Word -- selectedWord = wordBank[i]
            //Display Selcted Word  - selectedWord

// listen for keystroke from user (userKeystroke)

//Set number allowed of number of guesses

//Check user guess keystrokes against selectedWord[i], 
        //display Letter in correct Way
        //subtract from one number of guesses left
        // play success sound 
// else display key stoke as Letters Guessed
        //subtract from one number of guesses left
        // play defeat sound
